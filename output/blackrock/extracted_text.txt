responses to public consultations and white papers called ViewPoints) are available on the Public Policy website.

eliminate redundant data input across multiple systems, enhance data integrity through shared and transparent
information, and increase operating efficiencies and controls.
Whilst proprietary technology platforms may help manage risk, risk cannot be eliminated.
