An Important Step
toward Standards
The DASCP is a strategic road map, aiming to provide
the industry with a proposal on how DAS can be
managed, regulated, and scaled. Such a strategic
road map paves the way for standards by:
• Forging a Common Language: A shared
understanding of terminology and concepts is
a cornerstone of effective standardization.
• Enabling Regulatory Clarity: Developed in
collaboration with BCG, which reviewed over
100 regulations and engaged with more than
20 key market participants to ensure alignment
with both existing and emerging global
regulatory frameworks. This clarity in regulation
is critical for the advancement of DAS.
• Providing a Blueprint for Industry-Wide Alignment:
Developing the capabilities to form an aligned
perspective on controls is essential for subsequent
industry-wide alignment processes. The principles
act as a guiding force in the subsequent phases
of DAS adoption, ensuring that standards reflect
the collective insights of the entire industry.

and comprehensiveness amid global regulatory diversity.
This case study showcases the framework’s application
in a scenario involving token issuance, transfer, and
lending, where the risk management controls are
seamlessly integrated into the digital asset transaction
flow. This example presents the automation of
numerous processes using digital assets, ensuring
accurate controls, and reducing manual oversight.
In translating these principles into practice, the
figure on page 17 maps the controls applied at each
transactional junction, demonstrating how specific
risks are addressed through tailored controls. The
central role of smart contracts is evident throughout the
process, offering a robust means to automate intricate
transaction sequences, ensure regulatory adherence, and
protect the integrity of the loan’s data and functions.

Description of major steps:
1 Asset Tokenization:
An asset manager issues a private security, such as a private equity fund, which is then tokenized on a private blockchain by a custodian.
2 Token Transfer:
The custodian moves the newly created PE (Private Equity) tokens from the private ledger to a public-permissioned ledger for wider distribution.
3 KYC Enforcement:
As tokens are distributed, KYC compliance checks are performed to ensure all investors meet regulatory standards, despite the change in blockchain.
4 Money Market Fund (MMF) Issuance:
In parallel, an asset manager issues a Money Market Fund.
5 MMF Tokenization for Lending:
The custodian tokenizes the MMF shares and makes them available for lending in the Securities Lending Market.
6 Collateral Deposit:
Investors with tokenized PE fund shares deposit these tokens into the lending pool to serve as collateral.
7 Lending Pool Transactions:
Using the collateral provided, investors borrow more liquid assets (e.g., MMF shares) from the lending pool.
8 Automated Lending Operations:
The lending process, powered by smart contracts, automates the workflow, including the deposit, loan issuance, and approval, and
upon maturity, manages repayment and interest distribution and returns the securities to their original owners.

The chart below presents a detailed illustration of the DASCP controls in action, delineating the specific methods used for its implementation. While these
examples highlight the controls’ functionality and the potential for smart contracts to reinforce the robustness of the DAS market, they are intended to
serve as illustrations of what can be achieved. They are not prescriptive; organizations are encouraged to interpret and adapt controls to fit their unique
environments, strategies, and compliance needs. This illustrative approach reaffirms the DASCP framework’s commitment to flexibility and its capacity to

Next Steps in the customizations within the community, we aim to
accelerate the adoption and enhance the effectiveness
Evolution of the DASCP of the DASCP across diverse financial ecosystems.
To foster open dialogue and collective intelligence,
we intend to engage the industry through a series
of in-depth discussions involving key stakeholders
from across the financial sector. These exchanges
will serve as a platform to share insights and best
practices, as well as to collaboratively address
the concerns and challenges faced by various
players in implementing the control principles.
Also, we plan to transition the stewardship of the DASCP
to an industry association, ensuring its continuous
enhancement and compliance with global regulations.
Industry associations play a pivotal role in uniting market
participants around common goals. This strategic
move not only guarantees continuous improvement
and expansion of the DASCP but also empowers the
association to leverage it as a foundational document.
This will facilitate the integration of secondary trading
risks and controls, and the development of additional
standards to bolster interoperability, security, and
compliance in the digital asset securities landscape.
We will continue to shape the market effectively
as we build upon the foundation of our previous
collaborative efforts that call for pioneering cash on-
chain initiatives and establishing new standards.9
We are committed to continuously sharing insights
and supporting adaptations of the DASCP to meet
specific regional requirements, technology stacks, and
operational environments. By disseminating these

just one of several critical components required
for full-scale adoption. Ongoing developments
in interoperability, cash on-chain initiatives,
scalable solutions, and the formulation of strong
business cases remain essential to achieving
comprehensive integration and value realization.
We extend our gratitude to all participants whose
engagement has been helpful in shaping a
framework that promises to be both foundational
and transformative. Integrating these principles
into future standards will be vital for enhancing
security, efficiency, and promoting broad-
based innovation within the industry.
We are committed to not just working together
but to moving forward with a purpose. This is
a call for industry-wide mobilization to support
a vision. Let us unite in this endeavor to build a
robust, integrated financial future. Together, we
can advance the era of digital asset securities.

Complete Risk and
Control Taxonomy
The detailed descriptions of risks and controls,
as well as a view on which risks are mitigated
by which controls, is shown below.
Detailed Risk Description:
To enhance the effectiveness of our framework, each
risk is aligned with one of six principles, ranked from
highest to lowest priority. (1) Legal Certainty is deemed
the most urgent, while (6) Operational Scalability is
considered the least. This ranking does not diminish
the importance of any principle, as all are required to
establish a vibrant DAS ecosystem. When a risk could
be associated with multiple principles, it is assigned
to the principle of highest priority. By doing so, we
not only ensure a concise framework presentation
but also prioritize the risk management process.
Detailed Controls Description:
Controls are mapped to the risks they
are mitigating in a way that one control
addresses either one or multiple risks.
